## About

This project was intended to do 2 things, 1: create a board that fits original Planck-style Lo Pro cases with minor modifications, and 2: gain a better understanding of keyboard design theory by replicating one of my favorite form factors. The Kurako 40 was meant to fill a very specific niche: I needed a replacement board and I couldn't find just the board itself. I was also tiring of sales where both PCB and case must be purchased together.

Here we are a year later, spending far more on R&D than if I were to just buy an entirely new prebuilt, but where's the fun in that ;)
